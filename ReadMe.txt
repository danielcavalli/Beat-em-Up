A project to test mechanics of beat'em up games. The focus of this project is to visualize possible mechanical for a beat'em up that I and my group are developing.

The changes in the version 1.4.2.09 is:

- Sound to hitmark
- Theme game sound
- Jump was improved
- The other changes are minoritaries

In this version we have escaped a little of the project's main idea.
